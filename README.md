# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm [Jeny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamatya/).

With 15 years of diverse experience in IT sector, I have come a long way from first programming job as a bright-eyed, curious coder to my current role as more mature (maybe?) and experienced (definitely!) Senior Technical Specialist in Queensland Department of Education. And because I love what I do, it doesn't feel like I have spent so many years typing away in front on the screen. 

Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on projects of different complexities, tech stacks and team structure, with hands-on involvement in requirement gathering and analysis, software architecture and design, implementation, testing, delivery, post-production support, along with project planning and resource allocation. 

I am an avid advocate of agile methodologies and always try to blend these practices in any team I work with. It's a pure delight to get a Scrum team working well with each other, with seamless transparency, communication and no hierarchical boundary!

One of my personal belief is that anyone can do anything. They just need to figure out the algorithm that works! It applies not just to a project implementation, but to anything that we do in our lives.
